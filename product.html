        <h2>
            The PS5, also known as the PlayStation 5, has finally been confirmed by Sony and will be arriving close to Christmas 2020.
          We also have know about a number of features the PS5 will have, including ray tracing support, thanks to several Wired pieces.
          This includes an interview with Mark Cerny announcing the system, which revealed the basics of the PS5 specs and tech details,
          and another that confirmed small details about the console.</h2>

          <h2>PS5 supports expandable storage, but don't buy an NVME drive
          without Sony validation if you want to use it with the console. PS5 will support backwards compatibility with seemingly
          all PS4 games, due to it being "based in part on the PS4's architecture." The performance boost of the PS5 is so significant,
          however, that these games will need testing. Sony has said that the majority of the top 100 most played games are working,
          so expect support for the biggest PS4 titles at launch.</h2>

          <br><h2>At first some games may be released on both the PS4 and PS5 at the
          same time. We'll find out whether or not any games, especially release titles, will be cross-gen closer to the PS5's release date.
          PS5 offers a digital-only version and one which can support physical media. Both options will be available at launch.
          Game installations will be more configurable thanks to the way the SSD works (look below) players will be able to delete a
          single-player campaign for example, without removing the multiplayer, if the developers provide this support.</h2>
